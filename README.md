# Getting to Know Me

Iâ€™m Dimitris, a junior designer and web developer from Greece. I help businesses, from startups to established brands, create strong visual identities through thoughtful branding, which includes designing color palettes, logos, brand guidelines, and print materials such as menus and packaging. Digitally, I build custom websites, from visually engaging landing pages to comprehensive multi-page sites, using robust content management systems to turn visitors into loyal customers.
